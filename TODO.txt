- Add multimaps 
	To do this we probably should shove the "game" into a class and then add changeMap() and loadMap() as subfunctions of the class. That way we can trade around
	the GAME object, and just work off of it.
- Add portals
	This should be a simple event "portal" with a map and position. 
- Add damage, bots
	Simple enough?
- Add doors
	Need a object class, from there we check if any objects are on the map (printing the correct character (obj.char) if needed, and hitcheck). Maybe do something like go = OBJECTS[nPos].check() which would return True if it's okay to pass through/enter, and False otherwise. Maybe add a messagin system?

Updates:
- Allow slot choice when picking up items

Fixes:
